# Surface-Tension-and-Bubbles

A mini project for kids who are interested in Python programming and like math and physics. 
Using Python Pygame library code we present the following animation. Letâ€™s blow two air balloons 
of different diameters on the opposite ends of a tube that has a valve on it.  The valve is made 
in the form of a rotating triangular joint that can be connected either with one or the other balloon, 
or both balloons can be connected to each other. When balloons touch, the larger is inflated by the smaller
until the big one will blow up. This phenomenon can be explained by the gauge pressure which is 
(due to the surface tension) in a balloon inversely proportional to its radius, so the smaller balloon
has a greater gauge internal pressure than the larger balloon, resulting in the smaller balloon pushes 
air into the larger balloon. The larger balloon becomes larger and larger and finally blows up.
